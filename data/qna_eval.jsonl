{"question": "How do you identify an incipient gear fault in a powerplant system?", "answers": ["Look for subtle vibration or noise signatures at harmonics/sidebands and follow the manual’s inspection and troubleshooting procedures."]}
{"question": "What is the function of a turbocharger in an aviation engine?", "answers": ["It increases engine power by compressing intake air, allowing more fuel to burn efficiently."]}
{"question": "Which manual should you consult for troubleshooting fuel system issues?", "answers": ["The FAA Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook – Powerplant."]}
{"question": "How can incipient gear faults in an aviation engine be detected?", "answers": ["By analysing vibration signatures, looking for sideband patterns in frequency spectra, and inspecting according to the maintenance manual."]}
{"question": "What is the primary purpose of engine oil in aircraft powerplants?", "answers": ["Lubrication, cooling, corrosion protection, and cleaning of engine components."]}
{"question": "How does a turbocharger improve engine performance?", "answers": ["It compresses intake air, allowing more fuel to burn and increasing engine power output."]}
{"question": "What are common symptoms of bearing wear in aircraft engines?", "answers": ["Excessive vibration, increased noise, higher operating temperatures, and abnormal oil analysis results."]}
{"question": "Why is regular borescope inspection important for turbine engines?", "answers": ["It allows early detection of cracks, erosion, and foreign object damage without engine disassembly."]}
